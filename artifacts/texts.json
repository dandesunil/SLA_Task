Note that: When you upgrade to Appliance version 121.0.0, you must install the new threatfeed package after the upgrade. Upgrading to this release will delete the old threatfeed package. To install the new threatfeed package: If you configure the auto-upgrade for the threatfeed package before the appliance upgrade, this configuration will be retained after the appliance upgrade. If you don\u2019t configure the auto-upgrade, the installation of the threatfeed package will occur approximately 10 minutes after enabling OPLP or DPOP mode. Alternatively, you can manually upgrade the threatfeed package instead of waiting for the auto-upgrade to initiate. Auto-Upgrade for DPOP & OPLP Added support for auto-upgrades for the DPOP and OPLP packages. Contact Netskope Support or your sales representative to enable this feature. Username & Password for the KMIP Server Added the ability to configure a username and password for the KMIP server. Configure Multiple Listening Ports for DPOP DPOP now supports listening for traffic on multiple ports instead of a single port. To learn more, see Configure the Appliance in Explicit Proxy Mode . Deprecation for DNS Proxy for DPOP Netskope will no longer support DNS proxy mode for DPOP.

Requirements for Virtual Appliance Version 132.0.0 Upgrading to version 132.0.0 Before downloading the upgrade package, ensure the following: You are running a minimum version of 124.0.0.125. If you are running appliance versions older than 124.0.0.125, or if the root (/) partition is less than 64 GB, you must deploy a new Virtual Appliance and import configurations from the old appliance. To learn more: Install a Virtual Appliance . Note If your Virtual Appliance uses a 64 GB root (/) partition, then you must ensure that at least 8 GB of free space is available before upgrading. There is at least 42 GB of free space on the /opt/ns/upgrades partition where the upgrade package is downloaded. You can delete older versions of the appliance from the upgrades folder to free up disk space. To learn more: Upgrade the Virtual Appliance . All the dhcp interfaces on the appliance are configured with a static IP, netmask and gateway. Export the current appliance configurations to a different host. To learn more: Exporting Configurations . To verify that the host is reachable, run the following telnet command. nsappliance> telnet host cz.archive.ubuntu.com port 80 Executing telnet as: ['telnet', 'cz.archive.ubuntu.com', '80'] Trying 217.31.202.63...

These older systems don\u2019t have enough space to unpack the new image during an upgrade, which led to unpack errors and halted the process.

This was because, internally, the status file was updated every 5 minutes. The status transition data showed the last 5 state transitions and a global state transition counter. None of these values were reset. The status all command was enhanced to show the short details of the last HA state transitions. 803074 The DPOP NSProxy showed high RSS usage that increased over time and residual connections were seen even when there was no traffic flow. In addition, nswatson -p 3214 -c \u201cshow stats httpmod\u201d showed non-zero flows. If the client terminated the connection by sending FIN/RST after a HTTP request was sent to the server, it would not be forwarded to the server until the server responded. If for some reason the server didn\u2019t respond, then the connection was never cleaned up, leading to half-closed connections. As a solution, use the following commands: \"send-fin-to-back-timer-enabled\": true, \"send-fin-to-back-timeout\": 300 // seconds After receiving the FIN/RST from the front connection, a timer of 300 seconds starts. After this time expires, Netskope sends the FIN back to the back connection to clear the connection."]
