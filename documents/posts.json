This update helps internal apps load fully and safely without requiring customers to rework legacy components.<br><strong>Summary</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Improved reliability: Pages with mixed content now render consistently in Enterprise Browser.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Admin-friendly: Simple per-app control in Private App settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security by default: Insecure resources are upgraded to secure requests when possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple enablement: Controlled via Private App settings; no major architecture changes required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Periodic Authentication for Real-time Policy Framework</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Netskope Private Access introduces a new feature for per-app authentication as part of Real-Time policy controls. Customers can now define authentication requirements based on a wide range of source and destination criteria and configure the appropriate timer. Whenever a user tries to access, the user will receive a customizable End-User Notification and afterwards be requested to authenticate or re-authenticate. We recommended you use Per App Authentication or Device Level Reauthentication instead of both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supported minimum Client version: </strong>131.0.0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Updated the NPA Tunnel Re-auth Behavior</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If NPA re-authentication is triggered when Windows Desktop is in hibernate mode (AOAC support), users had to refresh a authentication window with a session expired error on wake-up. Netskope Private Access is now aware of system status and ensures a clean refreshed authentication is started on wake up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supported minimum Client version: </strong>133.0.0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">NPA Data Plane Publisher Gateway (Stitcher) Performance Improvements</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Improved the Netskope NPA Data Plane Publisher Gateway (Stitcher) to process faster and scale better for high-demand workloads, increasing overall performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since R133, this improvement has been rolled out to specific Data Planes and will extend to all Data Planes in upcoming releases.</p>\n\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion\" style=\"border-color: #f1f1f1;\" id=\"ub-content-toggle-panel-block-\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-title-wrap\" style=\"background-color: #f1f1f1;\" aria-controls=\"ub-content-toggle-panel-1-\" tabindex=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-title ub-content-toggle-title-\" style=\"color: #000000; \">Publisher</h2>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-toggle-wrap right\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-state-indicator wp-block-ub-chevron-down\"></span></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div role=\"region\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-content-wrap ub-hide\" id=\"ub-content-toggle-panel-1-\">\n\n<p>Software Version: 133.0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supported Publisher Versions: 133.0, 132.0, and 131.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Availability Date: December 10, 2025 </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"updated-kernel-versions\">Updated Kernel Versions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th>Kernel Version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OVA<br>VHDX<br>AMI<br>VHD</td><td>5.15.0-161-generic<br>6.8.0-1041-azure<br>6.5.0-1024-aws<br>6.8.0-1041-azure</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"anyapp-rdp-reliability-enhancement\">SHA Hash for Publisher Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Image Type</th><th>SHA256</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OVA</td><td>5b6938ae609327c4b86bfb0d676dc82331e21321b4c39951116d6052fde7ecac</td></tr><tr><td>VHDX</td><td>dd34595dd0afcaa88f69f75db33ad67d1626c8ee577ec08ec831d15d1b14acb3</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ova-vhdx-hosting-on-the-alicloud\">OVA/VHDX Hosting on the Alicloud</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OVA hosting on the AliCloud: <a class=\"external-link\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://npa-ova.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/latest/NetskopePrivateAccessPublisher.ova\">https://npa-ova.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/latest/NetskopePrivateAccessPublisher.ova</a><br>VHDX hosting on the AliCloud: <a class=\"external-link\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://npa-ova.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/latest/NetskopePrivateAccessPublisher.vhdx\">https://npa-ova.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/latest/NetskopePrivateAccessPublisher.vhdx</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhanced Publisher bind9 Settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This change improved container stability by retrying to retrieve the DNS servers from <code>/etc/hosts</code> on the host OS.</p>\n\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion\" style=\"border-color: #f1f1f1;\" id=\"ub-content-toggle-panel-block-\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-title-wrap\" style=\"background-color: #f1f1f1;\" aria-controls=\"ub-content-toggle-panel-14-\" tabindex=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-title ub-content-toggle-title-\" style=\"color: #000000; \">Local Broker</h2>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-toggle-wrap right\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-state-indicator wp-block-ub-chevron-down\"></span></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div role=\"region\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"wp-block-ub-content-toggle-accordion-content-wrap ub-hide\" id=\"ub-content-toggle-panel-14-\">\n\n<p>Software Version: 133.0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supported Local Broker Versions: 133.0 and 131.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Availability Date: December 16, 2025 </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Restrict Local Broker Name Change</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with release R133, the tenant user interface restricts changes to the Local Broker name after the initial configuration save.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">POP Name in Network Events </h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to this release, Network Events generated from a Local Broker did not show the <em>pop_name</em>.

Direct software upgrades are supported as long as the “from” and “to” software releases are within two versions apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netskope appliance releases are numbered in the form of X.X.X.X where the Xs represent the major, minor, hotfix, and build release numbers, respectively. For example, appliance release 110.0.0 and older releases are deprecated when appliance release 132.0.0 goes live. Release numbers are not sequential like 101, 102, and 103. Instead, release numbers jump numerically, like 124.0.0.125, 128.0.0, and 132.0.0, to reflect parity with the Netskope Cloud Releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following table provides the upgrade path to the latest software version.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group informaltable table-responsive\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes informaltable frame-box rules-all\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Current version</th><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Upgrade to version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Any version before 124.0.0.125</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">124.0.0.125</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">124.0.0.125</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">132.0.0</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">128.0.0</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">132.0.0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Releases that are outside the Netskope support period:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group itemizedlist\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list itemizedlist\">\n<li>Are not guaranteed to work with the latest cloud releases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are no longer tested by Netskope.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do not receive hotfixes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do not receive new feature updates.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>At our discretion, we may provide support for releases outside our support period.
